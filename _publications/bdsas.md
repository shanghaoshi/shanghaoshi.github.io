collection: publications
permalink: /publication/feco
excerpt: 'This paper presents a machine-learning-based IDS for IoT networks, namely FeCo. FeCo incorporates contrastive learning into FL framework to support distributed intrusion detection. FeCo obtains more representative feature vectors by contrastive learning. These feature vectors have higher discriminative power between normal and malicious traffic. This effectively enables FeCo to achieve better detection accuracy than other baselines.'
