title: "FLARE: Defending Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks via Latent Space Representations"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/flare.pdf
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a robust aggregation algorithm FLARE to protect FL against MPAs. Through analysis and experimental visualization, we demonstrate that PLR vector has high potentials in differentiating malicious/poisonous models from the benign ones. FLARE effectively minimizes the impact of malicious/poisonous models on the final aggregation by assigning low trust scores to those with diverging PLRs. '
